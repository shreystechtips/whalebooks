# Megaptera Tutorial

## Things that are *not* Humpback whales 
### *Hoc est a Megaptera novaeangliae*


##### Loud hiss: Perhaps rain or wind on the surface of the ocean; a common pattern that obscures quiet signals

##### A relatively quiet signal (and notice the mechanical clicks)

##### Loud background noise; and notice two sharp high-frequency clicks: From a sonar called an ADCP that measures ocean current

##### High frequencey vocalizations of (probably) dolphins; so *not* humpbacks; click **Fail**

##### need boat noise


##### This is mid-low-freq mechanical chatter noise apparent in many of the BBH images

## Things that *are* Humpback whales 
### We like to refer to them as *megaptera* which means 'big wing'

##### megaptera (Humpback whale): Two distinct calls. Listen for echoes from both. The echo is the call reflecting off the ocean surface. Try and correspond pitch to the height of the signal in the image.

##### low frequency megaptera calls, no overtones

##### Two megaptera calls seem to overlap (middle and final thirds)

##### a sequence of whups (sound 'bubbly') and the start of a clear call at the end

##### megaptera call with an amazing modulation (pitch change)

##### remarkable echo

##### Non-overtone megaptera vocal

##### clicking sound (resembles a picket fence): This resembles the call of a sperm whale which echo-locates. However there are studies indicating that humpbacks may echo-locate

##### 'mooing' sounds with an intense overtone pattern
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T03_00_10

##### very sharp clear whups
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T02_52_45

##### very deep loud moo/burping vocal
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T02_23_50

##### Unusual repeated chirping sounds; really need a whale biologist here
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T02_57_25

##### Loud clear megaptera signal in two parts; truncated on both sides

## Subtleties
### *Hoc esset cetus*

##### ADCP noise plus what I would classify as Mechanical Clutter; and yet clear megaptera whups are audible
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T06_17_50

##### This one is a faint but clear low frequency only megap; it needs to go way down in the list also
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T11_31_00

##### A complex signal to decipher: ADCP clicks, mechanical noise... but there is a faint call near the end

##### this is a megaptera moo (hovering below a lot of clutter)
