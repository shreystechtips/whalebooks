# Megaptera Tutorial

Loud hiss: Perhaps rain or wind on the surface of the ocean; a common pattern making it difficult to hear 
quiet signals of interest: Fail.

#### For contrast it would be good to have a quiet signal here


This is also loud background noise; notice the two sharp high-frequency clicks. The clicking instrument is a
special kind of sonar called an ADCP that is used by oceanographers to measure ocean currents.

#### Relocate this next one to much further down in the 'subtleties' section

This is a complex signal: ADCP clicks, some ongoing noise... but there is a faint call near the end: Whale.

#### Need Dolphin vocalizations at high frequency

#### This one is a faint but clear low frequency only megap; it needs to go way down in the list also

#### need boat noise



#### megaptera (Humpback whale): Two distinct calls. Listen for echoes from both. The echo is the call reflecting off the ocean surface. Try and correspond pitch to the height of the signal in the image.

#### low frequency megaptera calls, no overtones

#### Two megaptera calls seem to overlap (middle and final thirds)

#### ADCP noise plus what I would classify as Mechanical Clutter; and yet clear megaptera whups are audible

'mooing' that shows both continuous and staccato (picket fence) components

More megaptera calls; in the vertical direction there are many overtones (so it is a dashed line) and these are staccato in time giving the picket fence effect. Notice how it is irregular and feels articulated. This is an important way to distinguish megaptera vocalization from mechanical noise. Whale.

This is classified as Whale. 

http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T14_31_45

Regular boat noise; but there are two Megaptera calls audible: Whale.

Here there is a faint megaptera call mid-way but this is really a judgement call for you the player: It is so faint that it probably serves the project better to classify this one as Fail. A good criterion might be 'You listen to the clip and say Ah that is for sure a nice clear Humpback whale call'. In this case we recommend Fail.

A last megaptera example with an amazing pitch shift. This clearly shows the frequency band of the audible part of a humpback call. Classification: Whale.
