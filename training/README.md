# Megaptera Tutorial

## Things that are not Humpback whales (*Megaptera novaeangliae*)


##### Loud hiss: Perhaps rain or wind on the surface of the ocean; a common pattern that obscures quiet signals

##### For contrast it would be good to have a quiet signal here


##### Loud background noise; and notice two sharp high-frequency clicks: From a sonar called an ADCP that measures ocean current

##### Need a couple examples of dolphin vocalizations at high frequency

##### need boat noise

##### need the mid-freq mechanical noise

## Things that *are* Humpback whales (we like to abbreviate them as *megaptera* which means 'big wings')

##### megaptera (Humpback whale): Two distinct calls. Listen for echoes from both. The echo is the call reflecting off the ocean surface. Try and correspond pitch to the height of the signal in the image.

##### low frequency megaptera calls, no overtones

##### Two megaptera calls seem to overlap (middle and final thirds)

##### a sequence of whups (sound 'bubbly') and the start of a clear call at the end

##### megaptera call with an amazing modulation (pitch change)

##### remarkable echo

##### Non-overtone megaptera vocal

##### clicking sound (resembles a picket fence): This resembles the call of a sperm whale which echo-locates. However there are studies indicating that humpbacks may echo-locate

##### 'mooing' sounds with an intense overtone pattern

##### very sharp clear whups
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T02_52_45

##### very deep loud moo/burping vocal
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T02_23_50

##### Unusual repeated chirping sounds; really need a whale biologist here

##### Loud clear megaptera signal in two parts; truncated on both sides

## Subtleties

##### ADCP noise plus what I would classify as Mechanical Clutter; and yet clear megaptera whups are audible

##### This one is a faint but clear low frequency only megap; it needs to go way down in the list also
http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/review/LJ01C___2019_01_12___OO_HYEA1__YDH_2019_01_12T11_31_00

##### A complex signal to decipher: ADCP clicks, mechanical noise... but there is a faint call near the end
